"Love, oh love. How deep your beauty runs. Your smile, a rainbow; a breath of fresh air, a kiss of the sun. When the day falls into the night, you become the stars that bring me light..."

I bear no blame nor hate against the world...

But my heart lies still with thee,

And I will await

The day when again it will beat free."
