"Oh wind... Oh sweet wind, you see my sorrow?

I bear no blame nor hate against the world...

But my heart lies still with thee,

And I will await

The day when again it will beat free."

"When the moon's in full view, your shadow falls at my side, And we'll gaze upon each other, Till the night is gone. The wind will dance, my Windblume, Your tune the melody, And together we shall sing On a night like this..."
